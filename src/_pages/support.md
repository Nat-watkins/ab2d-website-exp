<p>What is the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/04/16/2019-06822/medicare-and-medicaid-programs-policy-and-technical-changes-to-the-medicare-advantage-medicare#page-15745" target="_blank" rel="noopener">final rule?</a></p>

<p>
    AB2D evaluates the data elements provided to PDP sponsors based on how well they support the permitted uses. Any proposed changes would be established through rulemaking. If you have any feedback, please email <a href="mailto:ab2d@cms.hhs.gov">ab2d@cms.hhs.gov</a>.

{% capture a6AccordionContent %}
<p>
    PDP sponsors must have an active Attestor at all times to access claims data. Your organization will not receive data during periods without an active Attestor. If your organization only has 1 Attestor, and they leave without a replacement, then your organization will lose access to the API until another active CEO, CFO, or COO attests.
</p>
<p>
    Re-attestation will restore access to the API, including historical claims data that was not accessible during the lapse in active attestation. It’s strongly encouraged to add multiple Attestors to reduce the risk of gaps in data access.
</p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture a7AccordionContent %}
<p>
  PDP sponsors have access to AB2D as long as they have an active Attestor.
</p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture a8AccordionContent %}
<p>
 The “final” query code is a custom FHIR extension that indicates a final bill for payment. This doesn’t necessarily mean the claim is finalized and complete. For example, it’s possible for a claim object with a “final” query code to be cancelled and resubmitted under a new claim ID.
 </p>
 <p>
Every time you pull the data, you will get the latest version of a claim. Claim objects have a lastUpdated field, which represents when the data was last refreshed by the API. This shows when AB2D received the update, not when the update was submitted to Medicare. <a href="{{ '/data-dictionary' | relative_url }}#identifying-claims-and-claim-versions-2">Learn how to use lastUpdated and claim ID to identify a unique instance of a claim.</a>
